# Production Project

The Production Project uses Javafx and the H2 database. Currently, it allows for the user to input the name, manufacturer, and type of a product in a Gui and then save that to a database. The skeleton of the project was made by Professor Vanselow at FGCU, the remainder of the project is made by me, Jairo Garciga. I am currently working on it and plan to complete it by early decemeber. This project has improved my ability of analyze and address problems in my code. I made it for an assignment for COP 3003, but I have tried my best to make it my own. Receiving a good score on this assignment is less important than learning the process and aquiring the skills that the assignment is teaching me.<br />
